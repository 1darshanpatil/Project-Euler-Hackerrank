Leonard Euler the master of us all: His work on mathematics is nothing less than a boon to mathematicians of the age. Gamma, Beta functions are just the example to prove his knowledge and the famous value of $\sum_{n\ge1} \frac 1{n^2} = \frac {\pi^2}{6} = \zeta(2)$. Because caterac he developed his intuition and imagination so much to making him able to solve complexed problems in his mind.
